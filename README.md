# Korean-open-speech-corpora
A list of Korean open speech corpora for Speech Technology research and development.

This list has a preference for free (i.e. no $ cost) and truly open corpora (e.g. released under a Creative Commons license or a Community Data License Agreement). Not all these corpora may meet those criteria, but all the following corpora are accessible and usable for research and/or commercial use.

Feel free to propse additions to the list!

It is strongly inspired by [open-speech-corpora](https://github.com/JRMeyer/open-speech-corpora)
